# Jarvan IV sound pack

I've been playing League of Legends for a long time now (3-4 years). I honestly don't even play J4 much but when the Warring Kingdoms skin came out... I had to buy it! This was a long time ago now, and at the time I didn't really know how to automate anything (and I was using a Mac which makes automation extremely difficult).

What I really wanted was a way to bring J4 to life with a Dynasty Warriors soundpack.

In this repository I intend to make such a sound pack and/or a template for other people to make their own champion sound packs.
